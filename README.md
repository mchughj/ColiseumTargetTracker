# ColiseumTargetTracker

During a recent trip from my brother he showed me a new addition to the [Coliseum V Facility](https://coliseumv.com/).  On the playfield
are two separate mounted slingshots from which players attempt to launch a ball into their opponent's goal.  The goals are 250 gallon water
containers with an aluminum housing around them.  They look like:

The goal is 18" wide by 23" tall.  

He asked if I could build a system for tracking successful goals and showing a point total for an ongoing game.  

To keep things simple to start we decided to go with Raspberry Pi with directly connected monitors for the display.  While I was 
really excited to replicate a huge 7 segment display that I had seen before (the 
[ninja timer project](https://learn.adafruit.com/ninja-timer-giant-7-segment-display)) a monitor is far less labor to 
employ and provides with more flexibility.  (It is also not as cool IMO. :))
